🧮 Calculator Application

📌 Overview

This project is a simple **Calculator Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to strengthen core JavaScript and front-end development skills by building a functional utility application. It focuses on handling user input, updating the display dynamically, and executing calculations safely.

🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML – Structure of the calculator
* CSS – Styling, layout, and button design
* JavaScript – Calculation logic and display updates

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

✨ Features

* Perform basic arithmetic operations
* Responsive and clean UI
* Button-based input handling
* Clear display functionality
* Error handling for invalid expressions

⚙️ How It Works

1. Users click numeric and operator buttons to build an expression.
2. The expression is displayed in real time on the screen.
3. Clicking the equals (`=`) button evaluates the expression.
4. The clear (`C`) button resets the display.
5. Invalid expressions are handled gracefully by showing an error message.

📂 Project Structure

* `index.html` – Calculator layout
* `style.css` – User interface styling
* `index.js` – Calculation logic

🚀 Future Enhancements

* Keyboard input support
* Advanced operations (percentage, square root)
* Improved mobile responsiveness
* Dark and light mode toggle

📖 Conclusion

This calculator project demonstrates a practical implementation of JavaScript logic combined with clean UI design. It serves as a solid beginner-friendly project to understand how front-end components work together in a real application.

If you want it **shorter**, **resume-focused**, or **portfolio-polished**, say it plainly.
